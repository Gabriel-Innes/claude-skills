# QuickBooks Desktop Assistant

A reference-backed Claude skill for **QuickBooks Desktop** SDK consultants and integrators. Ask in plain
English and it answers from bundled qbXML/QBFC reference material, cites where it came from, and tells you
what it could not verify. It never guesses a request name, a field, an OR-aggregate member or a qbXML
version — and it points you at Intuit's OSR (onscreen reference) for anything the bundled references don't
cover.

> **Desktop, not Online.** This skill is the QuickBooks *Desktop* SDK (qbXML over QBFC / QBXMLRP2 / the
> Web Connector, Windows-only COM). QuickBooks *Online* is a different REST/JSON API — the skill will say
> so rather than answer a QBO question wrongly.

## What it does

| Ask about | What you get |
|---|---|
| **qbXML / QBFC development (C#)** | Correct C# against the QB SDK: `QBSessionManager` session lifecycle, building a message set at the right version, appending Add/Mod/Query requests, OR aggregates, linking an invoice to a sales order, walking the response and checking every `StatusCode`, Mod with `EditSequence`. |
| **Object / field reference** | Which qbXML object or field holds what, the `ListID` / `TxnID` / `TxnLineID` / `EditSequence` model, Add vs Mod vs Query vs Void, OR (choice) fields, feature/version gating, and a catalogue of the common lists and transactions. |
| **Setup & connectivity** | QBFC vs QBXMLRP2 vs the Web Connector (QBWC), connection and company-file open modes, first-connection authorization and code-signing certificates, unattended / hosted topologies, the 32-bit / STA / local-install constraints, and common connection error signatures. |

The skill switches itself on whenever your question is about QuickBooks Desktop or the QB SDK, even if you
only mention `qbXML`, `QBFC`, `TxnID`, or a request like `InvoiceAdd`. There is no command to run.

### Example prompts

- "Show me C# with QBFC to add an invoice with two line items against QuickBooks Desktop."
- "I have a sales order TxnID and need to create an invoice that fulfils it — how do I link them in QBFC?"
- "What's the difference between ListID, TxnID and EditSequence, and when do I need EditSequence?"
- "Our Windows service posts to QuickBooks with no one logged in and fails with 'could not start QuickBooks'. Why?"
- "We're a SaaS app syncing to clients' on-premise QuickBooks we don't control — what's the right approach?"

## Install

### Option 1: Claude Code (terminal, desktop app Code tab, VS Code or JetBrains)

```
/plugin marketplace add fdtaljaard/claude-skills
/plugin install quickbooksdesktop-assistant@fdtaljaard-skills
```

To update later: `/plugin marketplace update fdtaljaard-skills`. To remove:
`/plugin uninstall quickbooksdesktop-assistant@fdtaljaard-skills`.

### Option 2: Claude desktop app and claude.ai (uploaded skill)

1. Get `quickbooksdesktop-assistant.skill` from the Releases page, or build it yourself (see
   [`MAINTENANCE.md`](MAINTENANCE.md), "Packaging").
2. In Claude, open **Settings, Capabilities, Skills** and upload the file.
3. If an older version is already listed, remove it first so only one copy triggers.

## How it answers

Every material claim comes from a file in `references/` and is cited, or is flagged "confirm in the OSR":

```
references/qbxml/    object-model.md (ListID/TxnID/EditSequence, verbs, OR aggregates, LinkToTxn,
                     versions & formats) and objects.md (catalogue of common lists & transactions)
references/qbfc/     csharp.md (correct QBFC idioms end to end) and common-mistakes.md
references/setup/    connectivity.md (QBFC vs QBXMLRP2 vs QBWC, modes, auth, constraints, errors)
```

Each folder has an `INDEX.md` with the source and verified date of every file. Because QuickBooks Desktop
has **no SQL schema** (the `.QBW` is proprietary, reachable only through the SDK), the authoritative
"schema" is Intuit's qbXML spec, documented object-by-object in the **OSR** — the skill treats the OSR as
the source of truth and tells you when to check it.

## Keeping it current and contributing

- [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) is what Claude loads; it describes routing, ground rules and each workflow.
- [`MAINTENANCE.md`](MAINTENANCE.md) explains how to bundle a real OSR export for deeper verification, add
  a capability, and refresh for a new SDK version.
- [`evals/evals.json`](evals/evals.json) holds test prompts per capability.
