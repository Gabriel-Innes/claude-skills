# Acumatica Assistant

A reference-backed Claude skill for **Acumatica ERP** consultants and integrators. Ask in plain English and it
looks the answer up in a bundled extraction of Acumatica's own Integration Development Guide, cites where it
came from, and tells you what it could not verify. It never guesses an endpoint URL, a query-parameter syntax,
a header, a status-code meaning or an OAuth scope.

## What it does

| Ask about | What you get |
|---|---|
| **REST integration development** | Generate and review HTTP requests and client code (any language) against the contract-based REST API: cookie sign-in and OAuth 2.0 / OIDC (all four flows, scopes, refresh, session rules), endpoint and contract versions (`Default/20.200.001` to `Default/26.200.001`, Contract Version 4 vs 5), the JSON record shape, `$filter` / `$expand` / `$select` / `$custom` / `$top` / `$skip` per contract version, create / update / PATCH / delete rules, actions and long-running operations, processing forms, generic inquiries, reports, custom and user-defined fields, attachments, license limits on sessions and requests, push notifications and webhooks. Backed by a catalogue of the 187 example requests the guide documents, with links to each page, and a 36-row common-mistakes checklist for code reviews. |
| **Exact entity, field and action names** | Which entity a form is exposed as, the fields of an entity and of its nested detail and linked entities, what `$expand` accepts, and the actions an entity has with their parameters. Looked up in a snapshot generated from the OpenAPI document (`swagger.json`) of the `Default/25.200.001` system endpoint (2025 R2, Contract Version 4): 119 top-level entities, 5,338 fields, 575 expand paths, 163 actions. Exact for that endpoint; for other `Default` versions the skill applies the documented differences and tells you what to confirm. |

The skill switches itself on whenever your question is about Acumatica, even if you only mention an endpoint
path, an entity like `SalesOrder`, a form ID like `SO301000`, or "connected applications". There is no command
to run. More capabilities (SOAP and OData, customization development, versions and upgrades) are planned.

### Example prompts

- "Write a request that creates a sales order with two lines for customer ABAKERY on Acumatica 2026 R2, then releases it from hold."
- "Our Acumatica instance is 2024 R2. Give me the `$filter` and `$expand` to list stock items changed since yesterday with their warehouse quantities."
- "Set up OAuth for a background service that syncs invoices nightly. Which flow and scopes, and how do we refresh?"
- "My PUT returns 200 but the field is unchanged. Why?"
- "Review this Python Acumatica client" (paste the code).
- "We poll the API every minute for new shipments. Is there a push option?"
- "We're on 2025 R2. Which fields does a sales order line have, and what can I `$expand` on a shipment?"

## Install

There are two ways to use the skill, depending on where you use Claude.

### Option 1: Claude Code (terminal, desktop app Code tab, VS Code or JetBrains)

Add this collection once, then install the skill. Type these in Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add fdtaljaard/claude-skills
/plugin install acumatica-assistant@fdtaljaard-skills
```

To update later: `/plugin marketplace update fdtaljaard-skills`. To remove: `/plugin uninstall acumatica-assistant@fdtaljaard-skills`.

### Option 2: Claude desktop app and claude.ai (uploaded skill)

The Claude desktop app and claude.ai accept a packaged skill file under **Settings, Capabilities, Skills**.

1. Get `acumatica-assistant.skill` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/fdtaljaard/claude-skills/releases).
   To build it yourself from this repository instead (needs Python 3.10+ and PyYAML):

   ```bash
   python skills/acumatica-assistant/scripts/package_skill.py skills/acumatica-assistant dist
   ```

   This validates the skill and writes `dist/acumatica-assistant.skill`.
2. In Claude, open **Settings, Capabilities, Skills** and upload the file.
3. If an older version of this skill is already listed, remove it first so only one copy triggers.

To update, upload the newer `.skill` file and remove the old one.

<details>
<summary>Other ways (developers)</summary>

With the [skills CLI](https://agentskills.io):

```bash
npx -y skills add fdtaljaard/claude-skills --skill acumatica-assistant --agent claude-code
```

Manually, copy the folder into your Claude skills directory (`~/.claude/skills/` for every project, or
`<project>/.claude/skills/` for one):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fdtaljaard/claude-skills.git
cp -r claude-skills/skills/acumatica-assistant ~/.claude/skills/
```

## How it answers

Every material claim comes from a file in `references/` and is cited:

```
references/rest/   the REST API guide, query parameters per contract version, authentication and license limits,
                   endpoint and contract versions, the generated examples catalogue, push notifications and
                   webhooks, and the common-mistakes checklist
references/endpoints/  the Default/25.200.001 contract generated from its swagger.json: entities with form IDs,
                   every field, the expand paths and the actions with their parameters
```

Each folder's `INDEX.md` lists the sources, the edition or build and the verified date of every file. The skill
states which endpoint and contract version it assumed, names only entities, fields and actions that are in the
`Default/25.200.001` contract snapshot or in the guide's own examples, says which, and asks you to confirm them
on your instance's OpenAPI document (`swagger.json`) or the Web Service Endpoints (SM207060) form when your
endpoint is a different one. No custom endpoint, customization or user-defined field is bundled.

## Keeping it current and contributing

- [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) is what Claude loads; it describes routing, ground rules, the workflow and the gotchas.
- [`MAINTENANCE.md`](MAINTENANCE.md) explains how to refresh the references when Acumatica publishes a new
  release of the guide, and how to add a capability.
- [`evals/evals.json`](evals/evals.json) holds test prompts per capability.
- Corrections and additions are welcome. See the repository's [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

field and action names of one system endpoint (`Default/25.200.001`, 2025 R2) are bundled as extracted from its
OpenAPI document; other endpoint versions and releases differ where the references say so and may differ
elsewhere. Confirm against Acumatica's documentation, and on the client's instance, before relying on any of it.
