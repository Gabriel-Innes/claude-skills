# Cin7 Assistant

A reference-backed Claude skill for **Cin7** consultants and integrators. Ask in plain English, it looks the
answer up in bundled, attributed references, cites where it came from, and tells you what it could not verify.

The first capability covers **Cin7 Core** (formerly DEAR Systems / DEAR Inventory) and its API v2. **Cin7
Omni** is a different product with its own API; nothing is bundled for it yet, and the skill says so when asked.

## What it does

| Ask about | What you get |
|---|---|
| **Cin7 Core API integration development.** "Connect to Cin7 Core and list the sales changed since yesterday", "create a sale order for customer X with two lines and authorise it", "receive stock on an advanced purchase", "void this stock transfer", "which fields does the sale invoice take, and which are required", "what does `BACKORDERED` mean", "set up a webhook for authorised invoices", "review my Cin7 sync code" | HTTP requests or client code built from a bundled extraction of the Cin7 Core developer portal: the two authentication headers, pagination (`page` / `limit` / `Total`), status codes and the 60-calls-per-minute limit, UTC ISO 8601 dates, void versus undo, the overwrite semantics of sub-document POSTs, the stage preconditions of sales and purchases, every documented endpoint (295 actions in 33 groups) with its field tables, parameters, request and response bodies, the status and type value lists, webhook events and retry rules, and a 31-rule common-mistakes checklist for reviews. Every answer names the reference file it used and what still needs confirming on your account. |

## Keeping it current and contributing

- [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) is what Claude loads; it describes routing, ground rules, the workflow and the gotchas.
- [`references/core-api/INDEX.md`](references/core-api/INDEX.md) lists every reference file with its source,
  verified date and known limits. The group files, endpoint catalogue and value lists are generated from the
  portal's API Blueprint export by `scripts/build_core_api_reference.py`.
- [`MAINTENANCE.md`](MAINTENANCE.md) explains the conventions, how to regenerate the references and how to add
  a capability.
- [`evals/evals.json`](evals/evals.json) holds test prompts per capability.
- Corrections and additions are welcome. See the repository's [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
